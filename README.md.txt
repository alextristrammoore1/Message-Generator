#Practice function to help re-learn basic programming skills. 

##The task was to create a function which generates a random message by utilising 3 parts of a sentence construction.  

##The package contains the following files:

-The main **HTML** page outlining the content of the page 
-The **CSS** file using basic formatting 
-The **JavaScript** file containing the code. 

###The code is made up of 3 arrays and then a function which randomly picks one of the options. There is then a call-back function which has a listener linked to a button.
